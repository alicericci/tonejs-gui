# Tonejs gui
 Tone.js synth gui - randomizer 
 Super simple tone.js synth randomiser. Demo [here](https://tools.alicericci.eu/tone-gui/). A simple one synth version is available on the files simple.html / simple.js 
 Iâ€™ve tested it with the metalSynth and MembraneSynth but it should work with the other ones as long as they have the same structure / be easy to adapt.
